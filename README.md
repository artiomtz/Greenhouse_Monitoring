# Greenhouse_Monitoring
 
 As a part of a course, my friend and I built an agriculture system to monitor temperature and soil moisture in different zones of a greenhouse by adjusting ventilation and aggregation motors. In addition, data was displayed on an LCD and the system could be controlled via a CLI. After the prototype was final, we designed and ordered a PCB. For this project we used the MSP430 by TI.
